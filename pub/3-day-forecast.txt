A. NOAA Geomagnetic Activity Observation and Forecast

The greatest observed 3 hr Kp over the past 24 hours was 3 (below NOAA
Scale levels).
The greatest expected 3 hr Kp for Sep 26-Sep 28 2021 is 6 (NOAA Scale
G2).

NOAA Kp index breakdown Sep 26-Sep 28 2021

            Sep 25     Sep 26     Sep 27
00-03UT        2          5 (G1)     2     
03-06UT        2          6 (G2)     2

15-18UT        4          3          2     
18-21UT        4          3          2     
21-00UT        5 (G1)     3          2     

Rationale: G1 (Minor) geomagnetic storm conditions are likely late on 26
Sep, and G1-G2 (Minor-Moderate) geomagnetic storms are likely early on
27 Sep, due to positive polarity CH HSS influence.

B. NOAA Solar Radiation Activity Observation and Forecast

Solar radiation, as observed by NOAA GOES-16 over the past 24 hours, was
below S-scale storm level thresholds.

Solar Radiation Storm Forecast for Sep 26-Sep 28 2021

              Sep 26  Sep 27  Sep 28
S1 or greater    1%      1%      1%

Rationale: No S1 (Minor) or greater solar radiation storms are expected.
No significant active region activity favorable for radiation storm
production is forecast.

C. NOAA Radio Blackout Activity and Forecast

No radio blackouts were observed over the past 24 hours.

Radio Blackout Forecast for Sep 26-Sep 28 2021

              Sep 26        Sep 27        Sep 28
R1-R2            5%            5%            5%
R3 or greater    1%            1%            1%

Rationale: No R1 (Minor) or greater radio blackouts are expected.  No
significant active region flare activity is forecast.
